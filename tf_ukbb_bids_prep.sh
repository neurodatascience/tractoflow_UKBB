# This  script is intended to be run from within a singularity shell session
# started with tractoflow_UKB/tf_shell_symtree.sh
# Once it is finished the resulting symlink farm can be squashed up and overlayed 
# onto the tractoflow singularity container to run the pipeline.
#
## TODO:
## Error control:
### 1. check for existing symlinktree directory, only create if needed
### 2. Do something more inteligent with the subjects with missing PA_dwi.json files
## NiceToHaves:
### 1. include this script into a singularity image that also includes
### scil_extract_b0.py
